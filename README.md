# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game built using the Pygame library in Python. The objective of the game is to control a snake and eat food to grow in size, while avoiding colliding with the boundaries of the game window or the snake's own tail. The game ends if the snake collides with any of these obstacles.

## Requirements

This game requires Python 3.10.10 and the Pygame library to be installed on your computer. To install Pygame, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
## How To Play?

1. To start the game, run the main.py file using Python. The game will start with a welcome screen that displays the game title and instructions on how to start the game. 
2. Press the Enter key to start playing.
3. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the snake in the desired direction. The snake will move continuously in the direction you choose until you change its direction again. 
4. Eat the food items that appear on the screen to grow in size and score points. The game ends if the snake collides with any of the obstacles mentioned above.

After the game ends, you will be prompted to start a new game or quit. Press the Enter key to start a new game or the Escape key to quit.
